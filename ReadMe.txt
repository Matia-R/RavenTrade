Description:

RavenTrade is a stock brokerage firm simulation that aims to emulate some of the features of popular trading platforms like Questrade and WealthSimple. The app provides a set of fictitious stocks that the user can perform transactions with such as buying, selling, and tracking stocks. Each stock has a collection of statistics for the user to view and use to help make financial decisions. The process of buying and selling stocks is closely accurate to real-world brockerages as the user is asked to specify at what time they would like to complete the transaction and the level of volatility at which to abort the transaction when it is ready to be processed.

Running:

*Important: you must have Node.js installed on your machine to run RavenTrade*
